  <center><h1>Aunt DuhKnee</h1></center>
    <p><bold>So! Tell me this isn't funny...</bold></p><br><br>
    <p>Not too long ago, I fight for this guy to move next to me.<br>
    He does... All is good and well.  Peace and Balance has been<br>
    restored to the world.</p><br><br>
    <p><bold>Then..</bold></p><br><br>
    <p>Fast forward to tonight, 9 o'clock PM on the 5th of May, 2025.<br>
    I get woken up by Aunt DuhKnee who has just moved into the room next<br>
    to me, by him opening up the door... "My bad," he says and closes the<br>
    door.  Then he continues to talk to whoever he's talking to in his<br>
    Ever-So-Quiet voice... Runs the vacuum running it into the wall between<br>
    our rooms...</p>
    <p><bold>I'm awake now... AND I have to pee...</bold></p><br><br>
    <p>I exit my room, and see Aunt DuhKnee moving his stuff into his new<br>
    room.  He apologizes for the news, and says, "But I got to do what I got<br>
    to do..." Another lovely, yet comical line from the public defender's office.<br>
    I make my way to the bathroom, moving his fan that he has blocking the door.<br>
    I pee...</p>
    <p><bold>Upon exiting the bathroom...</bold></p><br><br>
    <p>I make it a point to stop by the door to his room and say, "see this smile?<br>
    Don't forget it..." I hear him say, "I don't think I'll ever forget you..." or <br>
    *SomeThing* like that.  I return to my room laughing. This is what I do...</p>
    <p><bold>While sitting on my bed and typing this very document...</bold></p><br><br>
    <p>He opens up the door again after saying, "I'm about to open up this door again..."<br>
    Or *SomeThing* like that...To hang up some sort of hanger? God only knows that I...<br>
    Don't want to know... AnyWho... The point of this story is.  I was, am, and will<br>
    Cunt-In-You to laugh and smile about this... While this big guy... Does all of these<br>
    things... *AND* gets his butt hurt when I laugh at his comments during morning med...<br>
    This my friend... Is only a tiny, tiny tid bit... Of the funny shit that I see...</p>
