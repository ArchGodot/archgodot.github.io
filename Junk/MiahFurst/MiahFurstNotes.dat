So! I have not gotten around to making this stinking
video yet! Grr! This not accomplishing things is really 
starting to get on my nerves!  I am, however, learning
how to juggle now! So, I think I have to put that in 
me video! I actually had an idea for the video with 
juggling, and that is primarily why I started to learn 
how to do so.  I have also gotten my medicine switched
back to Vyvance, because I believe that is what I was 
on when I was doing the yoyo thing.  I am pretty sure 
that it is helping me with the juggling as well.  The 
other one I was on that was like Ritalin, I forgot the 
name... Anywho, that one did seem to help me with some 
things, but not as good as the Vyvance helps me with 
things like this.
