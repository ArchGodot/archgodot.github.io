1.) Letting Go of the Past
---------------------------
Have you ever wished that you could just start over?
Completely stop living the life you are living, and
start a total new life all together? Well, I only
have one question for you. What's stopping you? Yeah.
Seriously! What is stopping you?

If you think about it, the only thing that is stopping
you is you.  Due to an unfortunate event, I had found
Mice Elf without a choice.  I had found my current life
being ripped away from me. I had no choice but to start
a compoletely brand new one. BUT! It was honestly, THE
BEST thing that has ever happened to me. Let me explain.

Before being forced to give up my old life, I did not see
another way of living.  I did not see "A way out." Now, I 
not only see my new life from a new perspective, but I am
also capable of seeing many things in many different per- 
spectives. I have "freed my mind" in other words. And you
can do it to!

Now, I am not going to say that is going to be easy.  I am
not going to say that it will not require effort. But! I 
will say that was the best decision that I have ever made.
My new life is far from perfect, but I am am satisfied, not
only with the way that it is, but also with the way that it 
is becoming.
