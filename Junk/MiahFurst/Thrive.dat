20250209:01:05 - My Business Plan
----------------------------------
  I have alot of ideas and I am
doing my best to get somewhere in
life.  I am only making $11/hour
at Taco Bell, and am only getting
30 hours a week currently.  This
is not boding well with my plans.
  I would like to start my own
business, and would not mind having
my own sober house.  I am thinking
there might be a way that we could
help eachother out and not get in
eachother's way.
  If I could get away without having
to pay rent, or at the least a very
little ammount, that would help out
alot.  I do consider myself to be a 
decent house manager, and would not
mind doing what I can to help out on 
that front.
  Here's the thing, I am probably not 
going to be the only one that is going
to have these issues, and I would like
to focus on the next step.  Ninety days
is not enough, nor is six months really.
So I am thinking of running like an ex-
tended stay sober house.  For the people
that are serious about staying sober,
and need more time before they can manage 
on their own.  Sort of like me.
  So I have been there for nearly a year
now as we speak.  And as I said, I am not
quite ready to buy my house as of yet.  I 
do not want to have to pay rent if I can 
avoid doing so.  Primarily because it is 
going against my saving up for a house. 
  
20250205:06:43 - The Reason Why
--------------------------------
  I believe the reason why Thrive
I understand why Thrive wanted to
come in here and make all of those
changes.  They are not any different
than us really.  They were basically
sticking to what they know.
  You see, as alcoholics and addicts
(As *THEY* label us, and *want* *US*
to label *OURSELVES* for some God-
Forsaken reason) we are defined by 
our actions to a greater extent than 
our non-addict counterparts.
