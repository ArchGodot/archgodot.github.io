Having trouble posting your first YouTube
video? You are not alone! It took me over
a month before I even wrote this script!

I thought I could wing it, but every time
I sat down in front of the camera... I
either A.) Forgot what I was going to say
or B.) Started rambling on about this and
that, and essentially, not getting ANY
WHERE!

I finally did it! I finally posted my
first YouTube video! And I am going to
share with you some of the obstacles I
faced, and how I overcame them.

Obstacle #1: Not Wanting to Write Script!
-----------------------------------------
  Now, if you are anything like me... You
are probably thinking that, you could do a
good or even better job... WithOut writing
a script. And you *might* be right, but...
The chances are slim to none.  Especially
if this is your first video. So do yourself
a favor, and make your first goal, to write
a script! Trust me, you'll thank me later!
  Another thing you *could* try, if script
writing *REALLY* isn't for you, is to make
a verbal script. Basically, record what you
want to say on a sound recording app, but!
Make sure to keep them all in order, from
beginning to end! You could even listen to
it in an ear bud or 2 while you're recording
if that helps.

* Writing this script, seems to be helping
me quite a bit.  

Obstacle #2: Not Knowing WHAT to Talk About!
--------------------------------------------
  To be 100% completely honest with you... I
still do not know what I want to talk about.
That is essentially, why writing this script
is so important! I had decided to make this
video, about the struggles I had -- making
this video, and how to overcome them.
  That being said, even if I decide to talk
about something else for Miah Furst video...
I can then open up a new document for that
topic.
  Why did I pick this topic? Because, making
this YouTube video... Has been the only thing
on my mind, since I decided I was going to do
it! AND if I want to be able to concentrate
on *AnyThing* else! ... I'll have to put this
topic to rest first.

*  I do, however, have several ideas for other
videos.  One of them, for instance, is a clip
that has 2 of Mice Elves having a conversation.
Which is, oddly enough, how I decided on what
to talk about. I pictured someone asking me,
what interested me at the moment, and what I
would talk about... If given the chance, to
talk about *AnyThing*
  So, my advice to you would be... If you have
a good friend or family member, or maybe just
someone you talk to alot... And either A.) sit
and think about what you talk about given the
chance, or B.) Ask them!
  As for me? All I have been talking about, is
wanting to create a YouTube video. So! Here we
are!

Obstacle #3: Wanting To, But NOT Wanting To Too!
------------------------------------------------
  I found myself trying to talk myself out of it
quite a few times actually. I have not totally
narrowed down the reason for this. This could be
due to several things, including fear, self doubt,
low self esteem, and or perfectionism to name a
few. I am pretty sure that I struggle with all of
the above and probably more!
  But! That's okay! The important thing is to be
nice to yourself! You will have a really hard time
fixing any of those things, if you are being mean
to yourself.
  Remember to compliment yourself when you finish
any goal, no matter how small. Remember this is
more about progress than perfection.  If you only
get a little bit further each day, that is okay!
  Speaking of which, I have to go put my laundry
in the dryer! Go me! I am doing my laundry like a
big boy!

* Decisions, decisions! I already plan on making
a whole video on decision making.  That is quite
a big topic to cover there! But there is more to
Wanting To, But NOT Wanting To Too. For example,
right now, I just got home from work -- not even
an hour ago.  And I feel EXHAUSTED!
  Being tired, can cause all sorts of problems.
It can cause you to have more negative feelings,
more often for starters.  It can affect how you
talk yourself into things... Or out of them!
  So, ask yourself this? Are you tired? Are you
hungry? Thirsty? Self care is *VERY* important.
Not just for creating YouTube videos eithers...
  I have been feeling kind of guilty, because I
have been sleeping *ALOT* and not getting *ANY
WHERE* on this YouTube video. HowEver! I only
allow myself to feel guilty for a *VERY* brief
period of time. I *DO* my *BEST* to stop Mice
Elf *EVERY* time that I start to think or feel
anything negative.  I then remind myself, that
it is okay, and to take it easy on Mice Elf.
  This is where meditation comes in handy. You
could for example do the body scan meditation.
Or you could meditate on what you want to talk
about, or anything that seems to be getting in
the way... Basically, meditation helps you get
in touch with Yours Elf. But that is also for
another video.

Obstacle #4: Making Excuses and Perfectionism!
----------------------------------------------
  Now, you do not have to have autism or ADHD
to have perfectionism, or to make excuses for
why you don't do things. Although, I do think
that perfectionism probably does run very high
in the autistic community. I would actually
like to hear what you think about that. If you
have autism and perfectionism or if you do not
have autism, but have perfectionism, I would
appreciate it if you left a comment below.
  But back to the video. I have been catching
Mice Elf making excuses for not doing things.
Like the lighting isn't good enough, or there
should be something else in my background. I
then *ALLOW* Mice Elf, to get distracted...
  Perfectionism is not a joke, and I honestly
believe it needs to be dealt with accordingly.
It can cause quite a bit of problems, and it
is also something that might be worth getting
help with, or at the very least... Meditate on
it!
  I once said that I have a fear of success.
Now this may or may not be true the present
time, but being a perfectionist most definitely
is! Now I am not sure why I just kinda linked
those to issues together. Maybe because I did
not really have a fear of success to begin with
but it was my perfectionism stopping me all of
this time?
  How did I get passed perfectionism stopping me?
I will have to get back to you on that one! But
for now, while writing this script, I am actually
feeling some problems dissipate. I am beginning
to feel more confident, in what I am doing. So
*Hope Full Lee* I can basically write out exactly
what I am going to do, and then do it. And try to
remember, that this is my first video. It does
*NOT* have to be perfect! --Writing that down may
help too! I may write it several times!

* Add to ShotList!
Just do it! It does not have to be perfect!
It does *NOT* have to be perfect!
It does *NOT* have to be perfect!
It does *NOT* have to be perfect!



Obstacle #5: Distractions and Dealing With Life!
------------------------------------------------
  This too, could be another video in itself as
well! I have to do my laundry, and decide weather
or not I am going to go to sleep any time soon.
I am going to put my phone on my gimbal and take
it with me to do the laundry... This is one way
to multitask and add some personal B-Roll. This
could also help you stay focused on the task at
hand.  If nothing else, it is practice at taking
video of yourself in different environments and
etc,.
  It is also good to get up and away from the
computer every now and then.  Yep! That's what
I'm going to do now!

* Some Time Later *

  That was too funny! Speaking of distractions. I
had put my laundry in the washer, but when I came
back in my room. I started watching YouTube videos
instead of getting back to this script.  However,
I did catch myself, AND stop myself rather quickly.
  One thing that I use quite often is alarms. Yes,
I just set an alarm on my phone. Like if I want to
allow myself to watch some YouTube for an hour, I
set an alarm for 1 hour, and maybe an hour and 15
minutes too -- Just in case!
  Or you could set an alarm every half hour while
you are working on something. Just to remind Yours
Elf to stay focused on what you are trying to work
on. Don't forget to take breaks as well!
  As for having to deal with real life things like
laundry. Personally, I find it best to get those
things done right away. This way it is no longer
on your mind, and you can continue to focus on the
task at hand. But again, set an alarm if you think
that you may forget to get back to your project!
