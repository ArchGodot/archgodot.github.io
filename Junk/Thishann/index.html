        I should be sleeping, but I feel as though I *must* accomplish 
        *Something* before I do.  *Sighs* I have been in this exact same
        spot over and over again Mice Elf.  When m'lady mentioned the 
        loop she's stuck in, my heart sank.  I truly felt and still feel 
        her pain. But I have something now, that I have never had before.
    </p>
    <p>
        I still can not put into words what exactly it is that I have, but 
        I do know that it is a type of energy.  Well, maybe not so much as 
        the energy, but perhaps maybe a type of control of it.  As I do 
        believe that the energy has always been here.  I do not believe
        that reality has changed at all, but my perception of it has? Grr!
        Something like that, but AnyWho!
    </p>
    <p>
        I can not seem to fathom these thoughts and or feelings that I have 
        been having.  With all these "new teachings" that is.  The more I 
        learn, the less I seem to know.  Like, do I have these abilities to 
        change and or shape reality?  If so, should I not be testing this?
        OR... Perhaps this is something I should not mess with? *Boggles*
        And being alone? Why do I feel as though I *need* a partner? Or is 
        it that I just really want one? She mentioned the word partner! I 
        have been pondering this for days, and the words came out of her 
        mouth almost as if they were my own? Shifty nitz!
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, this is not what I had in mind when I started typing this. This 
        is more of something that I should have written in my journal instead. 
        BUT... Writing in my journal is not helping me get into the mindset 
        that I am trying to get into.  And maybe... Just maybe, if I start...
        Writing as if I were writing my "story" then I *might* get somewhere.
        And in turn, be breaking *my* loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's funny though, as before I always wanted to take someone with me.
        It was not untill recently that I even considered the possibility that,
        I may be the one who needs to be "taken." But what I feel is more than 
        likely the case is; we probably *need* eachother. If we are both INTJs 
        we are both our own best friends, and our own worst enemies.  And maybe,
        just maybe... We could help eachother out in ways no one else could?

        I won't lie.  I have honestly been searching for *SomeOne* for as long 
        as I can remember.  Not that I have not been doing a good job on my own,
        BUT! ... I am quite certain that having a partner would substantially
        increase not only my motivation, but also my... Energy? My life essense?
        I've felt this before, but I am quite certain that I have only began to 
        scratch the surface. I also will not lie and say that I am not afraid.
        I am afraid. I know I am afraid of success for some strange odd reason.
        But is that all I am afraid of? Will have to meditate on this... But 
        not now... Now it's time for sleep! TaTa for now!
