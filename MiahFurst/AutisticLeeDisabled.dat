# Is Autism a Disability?
# How Autism Disables Me!
# -----------------------

*** How Autism Disables Me ***
*** 8 Ways that having AuDHD disables me...
*** (AND can disable YOU!)

1.) Decision Making
--------------------
* Sure, alot of people struggle with making *BIG* decisions
*** Do something BIG here!
* But me, being Autistic...
* I struggle over making decisions
* That the *average* person...
* Wouldn't think twice about...
*** Let me OverShare ... ***
* I sometimes take a minute to decide...
* On what color boxers I want to wear
*** NOT *usually* to match my clothes, but... ***
* Because I want them to match my mood
* Or the *type* of day I *think* I am going to have
* Like for instance, I have been working from 5 to 5
* On Saturdays... At Taco Bell...
*** Today is Saturday! ***
* So this would be a black underwear day!
* Probably due to the fact that it is the color of...
*** DEATH, and I'm dying inside! ***
* And now, I'm having a hard time deciding...
* On weather or not I want to leave that part...
* Where it is, or move it, or take it Out
*** COMPLETELY ***
* Decisions, decisions...

2.) Giving Up On *EveryThing!*
-------------------------------
* Okay, this is probably more ADHD
* Yeah, this is totally the ADHD
* But I *VERY RARELY* finish *ANYTHING!*
* I am shocked that I actually finished
*** This Video! ***
* I will come back to this later on...
* Or will I?
*** Stares around the room ***

3.) Communication
------------------
* Now this is an interesting topic here...
* Because, I know a lot of people...
* That would argue, that I communicate...
* Just fine, or even quite well...
* Sure, I can speak *nearly* proper English
* And I am quit good at getting to the point
*** I tend to be quite direct! ***
* But when they say that having autism is like...
* Speaking a different language...
* That is an *UNDER STATEMENT!*
* And don't get me started on *INFO DUMPING!*
s* Hell, I might be doing that now...
* If not, I'm about to!

3.) Info Dumping and Over Sharing
----------------------------------
* Although this is a subcatagory of Communication
* It causing quite a few problems on it's own...
* So I find it worthy of it's own section!
* What is Info Dumping?
* An example would be, for instance...
* Someone asking me how I'm doing
* The average person (around here atleast)
* Would most likely just say good, and be done
* I, on the other hand...
* Might start telling you *EVERYTHING*
* from the time I woke up this morning...
* Or AfterNoon in my case?
* And Over Sharing?
* That's when I describe the state of my toe nails
* Which reminds me...
*** Show clip of cutting toe nails! ***

4.) Masking
------------
* Masking could also be a subcatagory of Communication
* Because it often involves saying things...
* That I *think* people *want* to hear, or more so 
* What I *think* I *SHOULD* say...
* Rather than what I *REALLY WANT* to say...
* This totally disrupts the process of evolution!
*** FOR EXAMPLE ***
* This along with decision making...
* Is making even what I want to say right now...
* Rather difficult!
* Because I subconsiously *try* to talk about
* What I *think* people *want* to hear
* Which can then lead to bottled up things...
* That I actually *DO WANT* to say...
* Which then in turn leads to...
*** INFO DUMPING ***
*** SHEW! *Panting* It can be exhausting! ***
* Which brings me to...

5.) Autistic Burn Out and or Melt Downs
----------------------------------------
* Autistic Burn Out and Melt Downs are...
* 2 Different Things, but...
* I'm adding them together for the sake of time...
*** Neovim puts the current time for me...
*** When I type the word time and hit enter?
*** Shifty Nitz! ... AnyWho...

6.) Distractions!
------------------
* The reason why they say that Autistic people
* Really have a hard time being interupted is...
* Most likely because we have an incredibly hard time...
* Getting back to where we were at, before the
*** INTERUPTION! ***
* This *ALONG* with the ADHD
*** Which often causes us to distract Ours Elves! ***
* Can be a total freakin' nightmare!

7.) Relationships and or Isolation
-----------------------------------
* Even before I ever considered being Autistic
* I used to say that I could be in a room...
* With 100 people, and feel...
*** COMPLETELY and UTTERLY... ALONE ***
* This along with not ever accomplishing things
* AND being able to make simple decisions
* AND sleeping all of the freaking time!
* AND acting goofy slash Masking
* AND oversharing
* AND the list goes on...
* Can make Relationships, quite...
*** FREAKIN' DIFFICULT! ***
* Thank God for the internet...
* Which allows autistic people to meet people
* Without leaving their room!
* But I am even struggling with that!
*** Hahahaha *laughs crazily* ***

8.) Mood Disorders (Depression?)
---------------------------------
* Living with all of these problems...
* No wonder why autistic people are prone to having
*** MOOD DISORDERS! ***
* I mean, seriously?
* Do I even have to explain this?
* Probably not, but I'm going to anyways...
* Because I'm Autistic ... Lemme Alone!
* Hahaha! *laughs crazily*
* Here's another funny tidbit...
* I'm so bad at decision making, that...
* I can't even decide on weather or not...
* I'm depressed!
* The struggle is real!
* But I was (I *believe*) misdiagnosed with...
* BiPolar -- More than once I think?
* Primarily because of my *COMMUNICATION* difficulties...
* And decision making abilities... When I *tried*
* To describe my problems to the shrink!
* I often gave up, shrugged my shoulders...
* And just figured I was doomed to being Miss UnderStood
* Which would full circle back around and leave me...
*** BEING DEPRESSED ***
*** SIGHS ***

9.) Circling back to Completing Tasks and Perfectionism
--------------------------------------------------------
* I said I would come back to this...
* Mainly because how hard of a time I had...
* Making Miah Furst YouTube Video!
* And deciding on weather or not...
* This video, *should* be... Miah Furst...
* I often feel like the things that I do are not...
*** Good Enough ***
* Which is why I move on to something else...
* Thinking that *maybe* I could do that... Better...
* I could totally INFO DUMP on Perfectionism
* And how it stops me from accomplishing *ANYTHING*
* Do you find yourself struggling with similiar problems?
* I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts and
* maybe clarifying that I am not so alone...
* If you could leave a comment below, I would...
*** LOVE *** to hear what you have to say...
* I do hope this video has helped at least one person
* If you struggle with any or all of these problems...
*** YOU ARE NOT ALONE ***
* Thank you for watching...
* Miah Bee You Tea Full Pee Pull!

*** Bloopers \ Take Outs? ***
* I don't think people would like to be called
* Pee Poles ...
* 200 lines of script! Am I done?
* Did I accomplish something?
* I'll be damned...

*** Side Note ***
* Take Osmo Pocket 3 and record Mice Elf
* In bed, with laptop (Like I am now)...
* Getting out of bed, and setting up phone
* to record Mice Elf...
* Laying in bed... (Like I am now!)
