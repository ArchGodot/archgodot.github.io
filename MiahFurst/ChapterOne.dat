Chapter One would start off with me speaking at the FellowShip Hall.
I would have shots from the side, within the crowd, and close ups of course.

Chapter One: An Ent Row Duck Shin

  In an A.A. meeting at a small podium, stands a small man.  If you were to ask
him how tall he was, he would most likely say that he was five foot nothin' in
ten foot of $H!T.  Both sides of the divided room are crowded with people. As 
the crowd begins to quiet down, he sips the glass of water in front of him and
slowly begins to speak.

  "My name is none of your damn business, and I suffer from being an autistic,
sarcastic jerk...With ADHD; Amongst other things.  Now, I would have introduced
myself as an alcoholic, but there's this old timer here that really hates it 
when people introduce themselves as anything other than an alcoholic. With 
that being said, I do have an austicly weird sense of humor that many people
seem to enjoy, and the others do not.  But we're not going to talk about them.
They will get all upset about that too. Heh." He takes another sip of water.

* While glancing down at his papers, his grey and white "skunk stripe" shows.
* Basically a streak of grey and white hair that goes straight down the middle 
* of his head; and leads to his pony tell that rests on the back-top of his
* head.

  Glancing down at his papers, he moves a couple around.  "So yeah, I had to 
write two versions of my speech.  Had I given him this uncensored one, he might 
not have let me speak today. But now that I have been given this great oppor-
tunity to share my life story... With all of you beautiful people.  I might as 
well go ahead and tell you a little bit about Mice Elf."

* Being autistic I would have to start at the damn beginning.  I was born in 
* early 1980 to my mom and dad, blah blah blah.  I had a decent upbringing, but 
* had not known I was autistic nor that I had ADHD until a much later age. This 
* had obviously caused me a ton of problems growing up, along with being five
* foot tall and grey, blah blah blah.
*
* Should probably fast track to my teenage years, to when I had gotten kicked
* out of Lutheran High and my mother had moved me to Brunswick with my brother
* and sister-in-law.  Oh yeah, almost forgot the little turd that was my nephew
* at the time.  This was when he came running from the other room, jumped on my 
* belly with a hard plop!  Then reached down and yanked some of my newly grown 
* arm pit hairs right out!  I wanted to keel him every time I felt the burn of 
* putting on deoderant.
*
* This was also the time I had met and fell in love with my first love, Cathy.
* She had lied about her age, and told me so at the same time she had told me 
* about her having cancer.  So I couldn't dump her.  I had decided then to help 
* her enjoy her life to the fullest in any way I could.  She was and still is,
* in many ways, one of the best people I have met... Even 'till this very day.
* She had earned an eternal spot in my heart, and I am very greatful that I had 
* been given the opportunity to get to know her.
*
* Then we would have to briefly talk about Penny of course.  Although we were 
* not together very long, she too holds a very important piece of my heart as 
* well.  And her (step) dad, Rich.  Who in many ways, was like a father to me 
* as well.  I'm sure there will be spots in the story for him as well!
*
* Then after Penny, there was Cindy.  My first wife. (I also should not forget
* to mention me great, goofy ass, uncle Rick. Who also took me under his wing, 
* and taught me quite a bit of things that I had needed to know. And more than 
* a few that I would have probably been better off not knowing. But we won't 
* talk about that either just yet.)
*
* Cindy, blah blah, marriage, kids... Long ass chapter of my life here, and a 
* whole lot can be said here.  Big Jamie... Then my first number one Beloved,
* Tracy.  She has also earned a special place and many chapters.  Althouogh our 
* time together was not all that long, it was very good quality.  I remember
* not wanting to go to sleep, while I laid next to her.  Knowing that it would 
* not last very long, I cherished every single moment with her that I could.
* But AnyWho!  Moving on...
*
* Then Melissa? I still love her to this very day, and she is also very dear to 
* me.  Nicole?  Wait a minute, damnit! Back the (beep) up!  I feel so bad! I 
* had almost forgot about my little, also short, special lady that I had met at 
* Speedway! Blah! Her name was close to Reanna, son of a... *Sighs* my memory 
* isn't quite what it used to be.  I may have to meditate on that one, as she 
* was also very special and near and dear to my heart as well.  Her and her son 
* who had starting wearing a belt and tucking his shirt in.  I hope that they 
* are both doing well!
*
* I had told Nicole that if we had not worked out, that I was done with women!
* At least for a little while, and I had stayed single and sexless for over
* four years! That was until my current Beloved had came along, and assisted me 
* into becoming my current, Kerimaniacal self.
*
* So, what are my desires? What do I want? I want to be with my Beloved, or at 
* the very least... Someone who I can coincide with peacefully, and have a good 
* healthy relationship with.  I have not given up on my Beloved just yet, but I 
* am also not going to hold my breath either. So, other than a finding a decent 
* partner to live my life with... I desire a way of making money that resonates 
* with my spirit.  Something that I would get "high" off of doing.  Like making 
* movies, shows, video games, or even books as it may be. I don't mind living
* with the struggle that I must go through in order for my spirit to grow, but 
* it is very crucial for me to not *HATE* having to go to my place of work.
*
* I can not stress this enough.  It is very important for people like us to...
* Find out where we belong.  Forcing ourselves to stay where we do not belong 
* never turns out well for any of us.  We must resonate with the work that we 
* do. I am not going to say that I desire getting rich and living an easy life.
* Not that I wouldn't enjoy that, and in many ways I feel as though I have in a 
* way, earned it even.  But if I was with someone that loved me for me, and had 
* a job that resonated with my soul?  I would be in heaven, and could ask for 
* nothing more.
*
* That being said, it's after 3 o'clock now on Saturday the 9th of August, 2025
* and I have to work tonight at 10 o'clock until close which will be after five
* in the morning... At Taco Bell... Making $11.35 an hour at the moment, which 
* is not exactly resonating with my soul!  My learning to juggle clubs is going 
* relatively well.  Not very fast, but ehh... I'm a patient man!  I had woken 
* up at a little after 1 o'clock, and had not gotten much sleep.  I *should* be 
* sleeping now!  So, I will *try* to go back to sleep, but if I fail... I shall 
* return!
*
* Wait! Before I go! I mentioned my desires, I *need* to mention my conflicts 
* real quick!  Obviously the ADHD and autism are and have been a constant 
* source of obstacles in my life!  As well as being short and grey.  And now,
* since my mother has passed... I am alone.  I have no family, no friends... 
* Well, I have Iris!  But she's in Colorado and doing the marriage thing at the 
* present time.  So loneliness? I believe we could say is another obstacle.
* Although, since I have been watching YouTube videos on the chosen ones, and 
* the intuitive introverts often being alone; I believe that I may be somewhat
* coming to terms with the possibility of being alone... For the rest of this 
* life at least.  But only time will tell!
*
* So, what could change or better yet I should say, what can I change?  That 
* would alter my story in a positive way? Perhaps, I should continue with this 
* idea of writing about the life that I want to live... Giving my character the 
* life that I would like to live, and maybe, just maybe... I too could live the 
* same life!  Maybe, just maybe... I could speak it into existence or what do 
* they call it? Manifest it?
*
* AnyWho!  I have spent quite a bit of time writing this today!  I really do 
* hope that I can continue this, and make something out of it! I think I will 
* do some more yoga, and meditate on this... And either get more sleep or get 
* something else productive accomplished! Either way, Ta Ta For Now!
