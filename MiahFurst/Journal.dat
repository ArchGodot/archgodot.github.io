Got woken up by something? Maybe?
Donovan Talking loud next door *mutters*
T.V. in living room loud too! *laughz*
Donovan came back to his room and is talking now...
I am going to lay back down and watch some more Merlin
Maybe I will get another hour or so sleep?
Be proud of Mice Elf! This is progress!
Get sticky notes? *MAYBE* she was/is right!
Maybe just woke up on own?
But it was not even 4
Can you use capture card to capture phone onto mac?
Laughing at Donovan's conversation:
* Cuz I'ma thug!
* He's a thug *laughz* Bajeezus!
Remembering: Patience is a virtue!
Debating on ordering another capture card
But! I do have the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 coming!
Should be here in less than a week! I can
possibly run some preview shots in the mean time
But *maybe* just preparing myself for when I get
it *might* be the *smart* and or *right* thing to do!

Instead of getting angry about being woken up...
I *choose* to perceive that I was either...

A.) Woken up by God? (Higher Self?)
B.) Had enough sleep and am ready to move on

Transfer these notes into database? Make app?
