02-06-2025 - Purr Pisses
-------------------------
Don't have time... DeAndre stopped by, have
to go to work, just woke up at 7:30pm, have
to be at work at 9 to 4amish.  I miss my mom
and I was thinking about creating a 3d char-
acter of her, and the song: Who Knew Heaven
Was a Place on Earth? That and Beck: I'm a
Loser Baby, so why don't you kill me... I am
also thinking about going ahead and buying
that stinking action 5 pro, because... I do
not see me making money doing anything else
at the present time, this society is not
ready to work with me, so I must get ready
to work with it instead... *mutters* Got to
go! TaTa for now!

01-08-2025 - Almost Midnight
-----------------------------
  It's almost midnight, so I had a hard time 
deciding if I should put 08 or 09 in the date.
I have stinking autocorrection or something
similiar to it on, in neovim, and it's driving
me freakin' nuts! There, now I got that out of
the way...
  I am at Taco Bell (working) at the moment. 


01-05-2025 - I can't concentrate!
----------------------------------
I really do not understand why in the hell ppl
watch football.  I don't understand why I can
not concentrate on anything, due to the fact
that Max is watching football on his phone. I
can't remember the name of the program I was
using to keep track of the stinking supplies
list.  I... Grr, can't concentrate... I think
I am going to eat and go to sleep!
   This isn't due to depression, I don't think.
I think this is due to the fact that I can't do
anything productive at the time, so sleeping is
the closest thing to doing something productive
that I can do! These people just don't freakin'
understand... I tell them time and time again,
but they just don't get it! I'm autistic damnit!
   Aish! One of these days maybe... One of these
days they *might* understand... Naww! I highly
doubt that! *laughz* Oh well, I'm going to eat
and try to gather my freakin' thoughts!
    I was supposed to be recording video for my
youtube video right now, but that's not going to
happen right now...
    I do love Max to death! He is a damn good
kid.  But I still don't understand why anyone
watches football.  It still does not make any
freakin' sense to me.  *Shrugz* I don't see the
point in watching people play games.  Is it not
more fun to play games or yourself? Or make a
game? Or a youtube video?
    I just don't get why people enjoy watching
other people play with a ball. It really does
not make any freakin' sense to me. Hah... But
what do I know.  TaTa for now!


12-28-2024 - Where is my miss Amazing?
--------------------------------------
There were these 2 girls at the drive through...
I asked the one driving how she was doing, and
she said "Amazing." 

12-27-2024 - Getting Things Done (Or NOT!)
-------------------------------------------
Business Idea - Bo Dublin - Slogan:
Me 1: We Get Things Done...
Me 2: That You Can't Do For YourSelf...

Distractions:
  My God! It is hard to get things done with the
people around here! I tell you... This is why I 
*try* to do things at night time, but then... I 
don't want to be too loud and disturb them. Is 
that not funny or what?


12-22-2024 - Being Okay With... Not Being Okay
----------------------------------------------
* Why I *love* Courtney
* My Outlook on Death

My Ourtlook On Death:
  Death is not a bad thing. We tend to look at it as
a bad thing, because we are selfish by nature. We tend
to think about what we are losing when someone passes
away, instead of what they are gaining. For starters,
they get to get the hell out of here! Heh...

  All jokes aside, I have always had a

Got woken up by something? Maybe?
Donovan Talking loud next door *mutters*
T.V. in living room loud too! *laughz*
Donovan came back to his room and is talking now...
I am going to lay back down and watch some more Merlin
Maybe I will get another hour or so sleep?
Be proud of Mice Elf! This is progress!
Get sticky notes? *MAYBE* she was/is right!
Maybe just woke up on own?
But it was not even 4
Can you use capture card to capture phone onto mac?
Laughing at Donovan's conversation:
* Cuz I'ma thug!
* He's a thug *laughz* Bajeezus!
Remembering: Patience is a virtue!
Debating on ordering another capture card
But! I do have the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 coming!
Should be here in less than a week! I can
possibly run some preview shots in the mean time
But *maybe* just preparing myself for when I get
it *might* be the *smart* and or *right* thing to do!

Instead of getting angry about being woken up...
I *choose* to perceive that I was either...

A.) Woken up by God? (Higher Self?)
B.) Had enough sleep and am ready to move on

Transfer these notes into database? Make app?
