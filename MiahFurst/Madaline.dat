-------------------------------------------------
  I find it kind of funny that I am writing this on
a Saturday night, while working at Taco Bell! But I
*kinda* have to do what my mind wants to do, when
my mind wants to do it! *IF* I do not, it will stay 
stuck on whatever it is, until I do so.  That being
said, I have decided to start writing down these
things, because *IF* I do *NOT* then, I will forget
by the time comes, and the solution is never reached.
  This autism thing has been my down fall throughout
*most* of my life!  *BUT* when the autism is not my
*MAIN* problem, then the ADHD is! Grr! But if I had
to rate my problems from most to least, I would have
to say that the autism causes me the most ammount of
problems.  That is not to say that the ADHD is not 
equally as bad.  But it is just with the ADHD, I can
relate to other people with ADHD.  With the autism
though... Not many people I can relate with on that
front.  My ex-wife says she's autistic too, but in a 
way I am not sure about that. If she does have it
though, it is still different than mine.  At least in
some ways.  But that's neither here nor there.
  As you can see, one of the two just got me there,
and I started drifting off to a different subject.
Which is kind of funny though, because that is pretty 
much what I was writing about.  I believe what I need
first would be an ADHD coach to help keep me on track.
I have quite a few ideas that I need to follow through 
with... To completion!
  So, why am I writing this to Madaline? Because, I am 
somewhat confused on what exactly am I supposed to get
out of our conversations.  Talking to someone is good,
but it only goes so far.  And as far as that goes, it
is kind of a double edged sword.  As I am spending
quite about of time to have this conversations.  Not 
to say that I don't consider them valuable, and I do 
enjoy seeing my people.  It is just I only have so 
much time, and I have alot that I *need* to be doing
in order to get to where I want to be. As my Beloved
Tracy told me, either you got my back, you're by my 
side, or you're in my way.  I just want to make sure 
you're not in my way I guess.


Akim dishes, but owes me like 30 dollars still methinks?
