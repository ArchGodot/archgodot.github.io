20250201:10:48 - Autism and Fast Food Jobs
-------------------------------------------
  First thing I must say is, I really do love
my job at Taco Bell!  The majority of my cust-
omers are top-notch, and I really do appreciate
them.  Most of the employees I work with are
also top-notch (most of the time) as well.
  That being said, I am *usually* the only
autistic person working there *most* of the
time, and I do *see* things that others often
do not.  And my struggles there are definitely
multiplied by the autism for sure.
  There was recently a post in the group chat,
stating that the service workers are not to be 
sitting down, while there are dishes to be done.
This, I do not have a problem with.  However,
I am currently working as the *only* service
worker at the time being, and there are three
food people... I'll be damned if I'm going to 
be doing all that running around -- By MICE ELF,
and then do dishes while they all sit down. And,
don't even get me started on the dishes...
  These guys mess with my autism all day long I
tell ya!  First of all, they will be throwing
dishes in the sink with so much food in them...
My dish water ends up having more food than soap
and then... When I go to drain the sink to refill
the bastard, I have all that food blocking the
freakin' drain... *AISH*


        BUT... ON the *BRIGHT* side...
On the bright side, I will have to say... I have
met some of the most beautiful ladies probably in
the entire world, in my drive through.  And not
to mention that *MOST* of my customers are just
the coolest bunch of people I have ever met.
