O20250205:06:43 - The Reason Why
--------------------------------
  I believe the reason why Thrive
I understand why Thrive wanted to
come in here and make all of those
changes.  They are not any different
than us really.  They were basically
sticking to what they know.
  You see, as alcoholics and addicts
(As *THEY* label us, and *want* *US*
to label *OURSELVES* for some God-
Forsaken reason) we are defined by 
our actions to a greater extent than 
our non-addict counterparts.
