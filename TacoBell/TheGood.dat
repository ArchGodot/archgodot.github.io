  Well hell! I started to write this last
night, while I was at work.  That, HowEver,
did not go very well.  As I did not get any
more free time after creating the empty
document.
   I was creating this file because I had
received a tip from this gentleman.  After 
I had given him his change, and his food. I
had glanced back over to the window and seen
him waving me over.  I went over, and opened
the window, and he handed me the six dollars
in change I had given him.  I thanked him,
and he drove off.
  This does not happen very often.  So, when
it does, it surprizingly catches me off guard
every damn time!  I don't get surprized very
easily, or very often either.
  So! I had just wanted to mention this, and
in some way... I would like to acknowledge
each and every one of my *AweSum* Customers,
and let them know that I do appreciate them
greatly!
  I am slowly, but surely preparing Mice Elf
for the next stage of my life.  Which, sadly,
will most likely involve me leaving Taco Bell.
  That being said, I would like to list the 
relatively short list of pros of working at 
Taco Bell. With number one obviousl being the 
great people that I have met at the place.
(Yes, I *have* to mention Miss Amazing one 
more time! (Although there were 2 of them!
And they were both amazing!) As I do hope to 
see her again!)
  There I go again, getting side-tracted. It
is now nearly 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and
I have only gotten 4 hours of sleep, if that.
This may be better off putting in my journal,
but this is where it will stay for now!
