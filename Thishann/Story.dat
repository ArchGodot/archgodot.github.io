I find this funny.  I have these thoughts that I want to write, but...
When I pull out the laptop and open up a blank document, I have a hard
time writing what I *wanted* to write.  Alas, when I said I find this
funny, I really do not! But... AnyWho!

  ThiShann. With all of these things I've been learning recently; about
being an INTJ or a "chosen one", or being autistic AND OR my practicing
of Buddhism... I really do not know what to do (or not to do!) with this
young lady!  BUT! I *do* know that she has earned a spot in my heart and 
she also keeps popping in and out of my thoughts.  More so in than out
recently.  So, appearently... *SomeThing* needs to be done about this!
But what?

  I have learned quite a bit in the last couple of years.  I do find Mice
Elf to be quite interested in her mind.  I almost feel jealous that she 
seems to know so much at such a young age.  As in, it would have been a 
little helpful to know some of these things a little bit earlier! But, I 
also know how we learned these things.  By going through hell.  And with 
that being said... What I used to think about these sort of relationships
has also changed.  But, has it really?

  If I am to be 100% honest with Mice Elf and her, I feel the *need* to 
put all my cards out on the table -- so to speak.  I'm sure that this is 
one of my autistic things, but I am also *positive* that no matter the 
outcome... It is the right thing to do!  I just *hope* that she understands
what I mean, and does not take anything the wrong way! As this does seem to 
happen quite often when I try to communicate with allistic people.  But, is 
she really allistic?  We seem to communicate rather well, which makes me 
question... But AnyWho!

  Back to the reason why I am typing this.  Allistic people would most likely 
see me as trying to save her.  But in all reality, I would rather teach her 
how to save herself.  Or even better; that she doesn't need saving.  I would 
like to empower her, be the fuel to her fire for once. Although it has just 
occured to me that what I would really like to happen, is if we could fuel 
eachother's fire!

  It has been one of my "reacurring thoughts" of having a "partner" to where
I would help her get where she wants to go in life at the same time she would 
be helping me.  Honestly, I could probably benefit with just having a body 
double, and I bet she could too.  HowEver!  I am *thinking* that if we *both* 
put our heads together and "teamed up" ... We could accomplish some amazing 
things! And at the very least, I am already full of gratitude just to have
someone I could talk to about these things!  She's already done more for me 
than she could probably imagine... (But maybe not since she's an INTJ too!)

  I must admit that with me being attracted to intellect and her being able to 
understand me.  That my attempt to resist being attracted to her is probably 
futile at best.  AnyWho! That voice that told me to get to writing is leaving 
me alone now, and now I *should* get some rest.  Stupid house meeting at 7:30 
and I have to work at 9?  Not sure when I should take my shower, and blah, blah 
blah! FFS, ta ta for now!
