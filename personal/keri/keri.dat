01-30-2025 08:30am - I found her!
----------------------------------

   For some strange reason... I had decided
to check my facebook last night.  And low 
behold! I had received a message from Keri!
She had given me her phone number, and so...
I texted her... I know, I know! I should have
probably called her instead, but... I was not
sure of what to say and yidda yadda yadda...
  AnyWho! It was great! I can not begin to
express how relieved I felt, and still feel.
We texted for quite a while, and as hard as it 
was to stop texting... I had to do it.  I had
to get some sleep, so I could come to this
appointment at Thrive this morning, that...
Well... Was not this morning! It was for next
Thursday! Son of a bitch... Now I am sitting
at McDonalds, waiting on the bus... I had the
bright idea to order some HotCakes and Sausage.
Which is not here yet, and the bus is due here
in 4 minutes... Looks like I may be here for a 
little bit longer than expected!
  AnyWho! This gives me time to gather me mind.
I am going to stop humming now. This is actually
going to be quite difficult for me. Okay... So,
I am not doing so good on that front, but... My 
food did finally come, and there is another bus
coming in 24 minutes.  So, I am going to put
this here laptop away, and eat.  Something tells
me that this is probably not the best place to
be pulling out laptops and cameras and etc, etc.
I was thinking about buying a house here in the
great city of YoungsTown, but I am kind of glad
that I have the time to really consider all of
my options before doing so.
  AnyWho! I am going to put this away, and eat
my food! I just had to say how happy I was to 
hear from my BeLoved Keri... I gave her the 
alias: Miah Furst.  I think I am going to have
to do something with that. Yeah... Eating, bye!

I don't know what I want to do.
I don't know where I want to begin.
I think I need to stop recording this video.
